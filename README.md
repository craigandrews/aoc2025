# Advent of Code 2025

This year I'm using Awk again. Why? Because I want to.

Most of it will be compatible with `nawk`, but if `gawk` presents a nice
alternative way to do something, I might use that instead or even as well. 

All the scripts are executable and can be run as follows:

```
$ ./part1.awk < input.txt
```

`nawk` compatible scripts are suffixed `.awk`, and scripts requiring `gawk`
will be suffixed `.gawk`.

Some of the days also have a Go solution if I wanted to go for raw speed.
There may be multiple parts in a single file. Run them from the directory
as follows:

```
$ go run . < input.txt
```
